4;James;1;5;6;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not and it shall be given him.

5;James;2;17;18;Faith, if it hath not works, is dead;Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
